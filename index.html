Where sources indicate influence rather than direct founding (for example, mission theological training institutions), I include them with wording that reflects significant association. Key relevant findings from the sources: Noble founded the original native-English school in Masulipatnam in 1843 that became Noble College; he worked with Rev. J. E. Sharkey (Sharkey Memorial / Sharkey High School for girls established 1847 is connected to the same mission milieu); the mission established a Vernacular Theological Institution at Masulipatnam (supplied native mission personnel); Noble's school was later upgraded to high school and then to college (Noble College), and the local mission/CSI institutions and parish structures in Machilipatnam are linked to his legacy. Reliability: Noble College official site and the Wikipedia article summarize institutional history and explicitly name Noble as founder; missiontheologyanglican and historical memoirs (Archive.org / HathiTrust) provide historical context and corroboration about missionary schools and theological training. Possible gaps: some mission-era institutions' formal modern names may differ (e.g., Sharkey Memorial School appears in mission histories and local references), but sources explicitly connect them to the same mission activity in Masulipatnam. I therefore list institutions that are clearly documented as founded by or significantly influenced by Robert Turlington Noble and the CMS mission work in Masulipatnam.", "related_institutions Citations [Source citations for this enrichment]": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_College,_Machilipatnam, https://www.careers360.com/colleges/noble-college-machilipatnam, https://noblecollegemtm.ac.in/, https://www.missiontheologyanglican.org/article/church-missionary-society-in-coastal-andhra-1850-1950-mediating-change-among-the-malas/, http://wikimapia.org/1520983/Noble-College, https://www.wisdomlib.org/concept/noble-college", "mission_organization [Mission Organization affiliation (if any, e.g., CMS, LMS, American Baptist Telugu Mission)]": "Church Missionary Society", "mission_organization Reasoning [Reasoning for the enrichment data]": "Multiple sources identify Robert Turlington Noble as being sent by the Church Missionary Society (CMS).
